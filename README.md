# Basic Visual Computer Network Diagram of NBA Season Games 

Hello, this is was a introductory practice project for me to utilize Google Collab by scraping data from any season NBA games and create a visual network diagram of which team defeats which team on a average basis. 
------------------
# Skills Developed 
**Data Scraping**
**Data Manipulation of Data Frames**
**Data Linking & Utilizing Dictionaries**
**Computer Network Diagram Libraries such as 'networkx'**
------------------
# Additional Info 

This doesnt account for all NBA games as it can't account for all of 2460 games played. Each team plays 83 games with 30 teams being in the league. The data sample is smaller but can account for a greater sample of data. 

This program just analyzes who has a greater win lose ratio against a certain team and creates edges according to that. IT DOES NOT LOOK FOR THE PROBABILITY statistics. 
------------------
# Stuff that can improve 

Try to utilize arenas, maybe go into some probability, whos is more likely to win at Home vs Away etc. 
Better graph representation.
