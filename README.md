# Basic Visual Computer Network Diagram of NBA Season Games#

Hello, this was an introductory practice project for me to utilize Google Collab by scraping data from any season NBA games and creating a visual network diagram of which team defeats which team on an average basis.

------------------
# Skills Developed 
**Data Scraping**
**Data Manipulation of Data Frames**
**Data Linking & Utilizing Dictionaries**
**Computer Network Diagram Libraries such as 'networkx'**
------------------
# Additional Info 

This doesn't account for all NBA games, as it can't account for all 2460 games played. Each team plays 83 games, and there are 30 teams in the league. The data sample is smaller but can account for a greater sample. 

This program just analyzes who has a greater win-loss ratio against a certain team and creates edges based on that. IT DOES NOT LOOK FOR THE PROBABILITY statistics. 
------------------
# Stuff that can improve 

Try to utilize arenas, maybe go into some probability, such as who is more likely to win at Home vs. Away, etc. 
Better graph representation.
